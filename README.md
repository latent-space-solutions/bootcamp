# Core ML Bootcamp

Update 1/21, we added the PDF for our slides 

# Structure of this repository

 In this course we build two apps: The "legal app" which answers questions about texts using DistilBERT and the "coffee brewing app" which uses Apple's included deep learning vision feature extractor.

You will find them in the directories "legalbookworm" and "brewingdiary". During the course we will implement the key AI components of these apps.

We devised a post-course home-study program in the directory "home-study". There you will find a step by step guide to build up these apps from scratch with exercise prompts.
